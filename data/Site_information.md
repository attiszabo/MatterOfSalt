## Africa: Great Rift Valley soda lakes

Probably the most famous soda lakes of the world are the ones of the East African Rift Valley. A comprehensive overview of these lakes can be found in the book by Schagerl (2016). For detailed information on the chemical composition of these lakes, refer to the recent study conducted by Lameck et al. (2023). However, it is worth noting that the availability of bacterial amplicon data from these sites is limited. In our study, we included 16S rRNA gene data from five water samples collected from Kenyan soda lakes, namely Bogoria, Elmenteita, Magadi, and Sonachi. These data were submitted under BioProject PRJNA187566 in the NCBI database. Due to the low number of reads, the two sequence sets from Lake Bogoria water were merged in the analysis.

## Asia: Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan encompasses an area approximately twice the size of Western Europe, boasts a remarkable array of permanent and intermittent aquatic habitats and wetlands, covering an estimated 37% of the country's total land area (Boros et al., 2017a). Urivaev (1959) estimated the steppe region of Central-Kazakhstan alone harbored 14 000 shallow freshwater and saline lakes. However, the impact of anthropogenic activities over the past decades has likely resulted in a decline in the abundance of these lakes. To the best of our knowledge, only very limited data is currently available on the planktonic prokaryotic communities of the saline-alkaline lakes of the country.
To bridge this knowledge gap, extensive sampling campaigns have been carried out in various semi-arid and arid regions of Kazakhstan in recent years by our research group. The goal of these campaigns was to identify soda lakes in Kazakhstan and to reveal the microbial community composition of previously uncharacterized aquatic habitats. 

*Northern Kazakhstan*

Water samples were collected during April-May 2015 to investigate the bacterial community composition of several steppe lakes. The analysis included 16S rRNA gene amplicon data from two freshwater and twelve saline lake sites, encompassing a salinity range of 0.5 to 149 g/L and pH values ranging from 7.9 to 9.5. For detailed information on the sampled lakes, refer to Boros et al. (2017).
South East: Balkhash-Alakol depression
Lake Balkhash is a large, shallow and slightly saline lake, ranking as the third largest lake in Eurasia in terms of area. Stretching approximately 600 km in length and varying between 9 and 75 km in width, Lake Balkhash covers a total surface area of 18 210 km2.  It consists of two distinct basins, separated by the Uzunaral Strait: a freshwater basin in the West and a saline, deeper water basin in the East. Despite its size, the average water depth remains relatively low, with the Western Basin reaching a maximum depth of 11 m and the Eastern Basin reaching 26 m. The salinity of Lake Balkhash ranges from 0.2 to 5.0 g/L (Sala et al., 2020).
Adjacent to Lake Balkhash, Lake Alakol is another important saline lake in the region. It covers an area of 2 650 km2 and measures 104 km in length from northwest to southeast, with a width of 52 km. Lake Alakol surpasses Lake Balkhash in depth, with an average depth of 22 m and a maximum depth of 54 m. Salinity varies with the lake axis and with depth, ranges between 1.1 and 10 g/L (Aladin & Plotnikov, 1993).
In our analysis, we included seven samples collected from different parts of Lake Balkhash during a monitoring campaign in September 2018.
Furthermore, an additional 27 samples were obtained during a sampling campaign in 2021, focusing on the southeastern shore of Lake Balkhash, Lake Alakol, and the surrounding saline, alkaline lakes. Based on the ion composition of the water, soda and soda-saline lakes were identified alongside the saline sites.

*West Kazakhstan (Aktobe Region) and South Kazakhstan (Zhambyl Region)*

In order to identify soda lakes in the Aktobe and Zhambyl regions of Kazakhstan, a sampling campaign was conducted during the years 2018 and 2019. The investigation focused on saline-alkaline water bodies located near the towns of Shalkar (north of the Aral Sea), Belkopa, and Akkol in the southern region. These sampling sites are situated in the Kazakh semi-desert and Central Asian northern desert regions, characterized by semi-arid and arid climates. For our analysis, nine selected samples were included. The salinity of these samples ranged from 1 to 248 g/L, representing a diverse range of saline conditions within the investigated alkaline lakes.

## Asia: Transbaikalia

*Barguzin Valley*

As part of our analysis, we included the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from a water (brine) sample collected from Lake Gudzhirganskoe. This alkaline lake is located in the valley of the Barguzin River, situated to the east of Lake Baikal, as described by Lavrentyeva et al. (2020).

*Lake Doroninskoe*

Lake Doroninskoe is a meromictic soda lake with a depth of approximately 6 meters. The lake is characterized by a pH level of around 10 and a salinity of approximately 27 g/L. The ion composition of the water reflects the typical characteristics of soda lakes (Gorlenko et al., 2010; Matyugina et al., 2018). Six water samples from 2.5 m, 3.0 m and 3.15 m depth were included in our analysis. These samples were collected during a diurnal campaign in September 2013, as described by Matyugina et al. (2018).

## Asia: Tibetan Plateau

Ji et al. (2019) conducted a study to investigate the bacterial community composition of 25 lakes located on the Tibetan Plateau, situated at altitudes ranging from 4 280 to 4 856 m above sea level. The sampling took place during the summer of 2015, focusing on 6 freshwater and 19 saline lakes with salinity levels ranging from 0.1 to 118 g/L. In our analysis, we utilized the 'Replicate ID 1' samples from the dataset provided by Ji et al. (2019). Additional physicochemical data for the sites was obtained from Yue et al. (2019). References for water ion composition can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Samples from lakes Baima Nam Co, Guogen Co, Gyarab Punco, Norma Co, and Wuma Co (Darab Co) were excluded from our analysis due to inaccessible ion composition data.

## Europe: Carpathian Basin, Pannonian Steppe

The Carpathian (or Pannonian) Basin is a broad flat alluvial basin in Central Europe shaped by two major rivers (Danube and Tisza) and bordered by high mountain ranges (Carpathians, Alps, and Dinarides). Within this region lies the Pannonian Steppe or Puszta, one of the largest grasslands in Europe, stretching from Austria to Serbia and covering a significant portion of Hungary. The Pannonian Steppe was once a forest steppe area with extensive wetlands, marshes, and lakes formed by regular river floods. It is characterized by soda lakes, pans (shallow lakes with high area to volume ratio), and a few saline lakes. Lake Neusiedler/Fertő and Lake Velence are the largest lakes in this area, with several shallow and intermittently dry pans also found in the region. These alkaline, saline lakes typically have salinity levels in the hyposaline range (3-20 g/L) and a pH above 9. The water in most soda lakes and pans appears turbid and grey due to the presence of inorganic clay particles, although some sites may have brown-colored water rich in humic material. Detailed information about the origin, nature, and conservation of these saline aquatic habitats can be found in the works of Boros et al. (2013, 2014, 2017b).

In recent years, several sampling campaigns have been conducted in soda lakes and pans of the Pannonian Steppe to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in bacterioplankton community structure. Various studies (Márton et al., 2023; Sinclair et al., 2015; Szabó et al., 2017, 2020; Szabó et al. 2022; Szuróczki et al., 2020; reviewed by Felföldi 2020) have provided valuable insights into these ecosystems. The current study incorporated samples collected from different locations and time periods, including soda pans in the Kiskunság National Park in Hungary (Szabó et al., 2017, 2020), Seewinkel soda pans in Austria (Sinclair et al., 2015), Lake Neusiedler/Fertő in Austria (Szuróczki et al., 2020), and other soda pans in Austria and Hungary (Márton et al., 2022, 2023; Szabó et al., 2022). Furthermore, samples were collected from a transect spanning the Pannonian Steppe, including the Seewinkel region in Austria and Vojvodina in Serbia (2018), as well as during a monitoring program in soda and saline lakes in Hungary (2021).

Additionally, surface water samples from Lacul Ursu and Lacul 'Plus' hypersaline lakes in Romania (2015), as well as freshwater sites from the Carpathian Basin (25 samples), were included in the analysis to compare bacterial communities within the same biogeographic region.

## North America: Cariboo Plateau

In their study, Zorz et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive investigation of microbial mat communities in four alkaline soda lakes located on the Cariboo Plateau in British Columbia, Canada. The Plateau is characterized by a basaltic bedrock formed during volcanic activity in the Miocene and Pliocene eras, which creates favorable conditions for the development of soda lakes due to the decreased levels of soluble calcium and magnesium resulting from volcanic rock weathering. The researchers collected samples from Deer Lake, Goodenough Lake, Last Chance Lake, and Probe Lake annually from 2014 to 2017, with the lakes exhibiting high pH levels ranging from 10.1 to 10.7 and high salinity levels ranging from 17 to 48 g/L. For our analysis, we incorporated fifteen 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries that were published alongside their study. High-quality metadata was provided for the years 2015 and 2017, and we extrapolated the metadata from the 2015 year to the years 2014 and 2016 for our analyses (Supplementary Table 1).

## North America: Mono Lake

Mono Lake is an  athalassic hypersaline, alkaline lake situated in California, USA, east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the western edge of the Great Basin. It has a high salinity of approximately 90 g/L and a pH of around 9.8. Although the lake is usually monomictic, it can undergo extended periods of stratification, especially following wet winters, resulting in a seasonal oxycline and anoxic conditions in its lower layer (Edwardson & Hollibaugh, 2018).
We included samples to our analysis collected from the epilimnion (above the chemocline at 12 m depth) at Station 6 in the south basin of Mono Lake. After quality filtering, the dataset included 16S rRNA gene amplicon sets from a sample collected at a depth of 10 meters in July 2012 (Edwardson & Hollibaugh 2018) and 9 samples collected at depths of 0, 5, 10, and 12 m from Phillips et al. (2021). From the latter study, the triplicate samples from September 2017 were merged for the analysis. Based on ion chemistry data provided by Nielsen & DePaolo (2013), the lake was classified as a soda type. It is important to note that chloride concentrations in the water are nearly as high as carbonates, and the sulfate content was also remarkable, approximately 17 e%. Williams (1998) reported a similar ionic composition, highlighting some variation in anionic composition with changing salinities, although it was not substantial.
